"""Live paper-trader config — multi-market TWAP-anchored panic-fade forward test.

Trades several Kalshi crypto series that ALL settle the same way (the simple mean
of 60 CF-Benchmarks RTI samples over the final 60s — confirmed from rules_primary
for every series). The strategy is unchanged; only the asset/strike differ:
  KXBTC15M  up/down, ATM (strike = prior 60s avg)     15-min   BTC/BRTI
  KXETH15M  up/down, ATM                               15-min   ETH/ERTI
  KXBTCD    above/below, fixed floor strike (`greater`) 1-hour  BTC/BRTI
  KXETHD    above/below, fixed floor strike (`greater`) 1-hour  ETH/ERTI
The two-sided "range" series (KXBTC/KXETH) are intentionally excluded — their
two-boundary margin doesn't fit the single-margin model the edge was validated on.

# windows in a 2-month backtest (right-skewed PnL) and is the unit-free form of
